# Hacettepe Duyurucusu

Who really enjoys visiting department websites regularly? Probably nobody. Now it's time to automate it with a Telegram BOT.\
[Hacettepe Duyurucusu](t.me/HacettepeDuyurucusuBot) offers you this simple service.

## Reminder

Old versions were using polling method. However, after switching to Heroku from local computer, I switched to webhook. You can explore the
difference with [this article](https://dzone.com/articles/evaluating-webhooks-vs-polling).

## Usage

You can use the [BOT](t.me/HacettepeDuyurucusuBot). It's open to any users.

Required libraries and modules are specified in the *requirements.txt*

**config.py** includes **API_KEY** which provided by Telegram, also chat ID etc.\
You can find your own chat IDs with **[getidsbot](t.me/getidsbot)**\
Also, you can get your free Telegram API from **[BotFather](t.me/BotFather)**

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Especially, you can help us with adding other department websites.\
You can also open issues if you encounter one while using the BOT or if you want to suggest a new feature.\

## In the future

> Other department websites will be added

> ~~Using mongodb as database~~

> ~~BOT will work for other users!~~

> ~~Buttons will be used for better UX~~

> ~~New documentations~~

> Minor UX improvements everytime needed

> To be continued... :)
