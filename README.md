## How To Contribute?

There are 4 ways of contributing for this project.

### Reporting Problems

This is the place if you are facing an issue while using the bot. To report it, you can use `/feedback` command and say hi to me! Even better, you can [open an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) on GitHub.

### Feature Requests

This is not something *that perfect* and you love forever :) If you have anything in your mind about improvements, go ahead and use `/feedback`. You can also use [issue page](https://github.com/furkansimsekli/hu-announcement-bot/issues) for it.

### Adding New Languages

Any language even [High Valyrian](https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/High_Valyrian). For a detailed instruction, go ahead and see [this](https://github.com/furkansimsekli/hu-announcement-bot/blob/master/locale/README.md).

### Development Stage

If you know a little bit Python, I'm sure you can do something. 

- There are lots of departments in Hacettepe University. Hacettepe Duyurucusu doesn't include them all, yet. You can grap a soup from [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and scrape the department website you want. Don't forget to visit [detailed instructions](https://github.com/furkansimsekli/hu-announcement-bot/tree/master/scraper).

- There might be open issues right now, maybe you know the solution and you have the free time. Any help is appreciated.

- You have an idea for a new feature and you want to help me with that? Sure. 

## How To Develop Telegram Bot?

1. Go to [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Create a new bot.
3. Take the token and keep it secret.
4. I use a wrapper called [python-telegram-bot](https://docs.python-telegram-bot.org/en/v20.0a2/index.html). They provide excellent stuff, but there are also other options. Try and use the one suits better.

You can also use this code to make a bot, it's [open-source](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source) licensed.
