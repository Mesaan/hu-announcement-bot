# Hacettepe Duyurucusu

Hacettepe Duyurucusu is a Telegram BOT that shares announcements from Hacettepe University Departments with the user.

## Reminder

This version is using polling method but in the future we will switch it to polling method. You can explore the
difference with [this article](https://dzone.com/articles/evaluating-webhooks-vs-polling).

## Usage

It's still in the early development stage, so it's not open to users, yet!\
Take a look at "**in the future**" section.

Required libraries and modules are specified in the *requirements.txt*

**config.py** includes **API_KEY** which provided by Telegram, also chat ID etc.\
You can find your own chat IDs with **[getidsbot](t.me/getidsbot)**\
Also, you can get your free **Telegram API** from **[BotFather](t.me/BotFather)**

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Especially, you can help us with adding other department websites.

## In the future

> Other department websites will be added

> Using mongodb for saving user configs

> BOT will work for other users!

> To be continued... :)
