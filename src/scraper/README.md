# Parsing Methods:

We generally used requests and beautifulsoup4 module for parsing the data from department websites.

# Contribution:

If you are going to add new departments, you don't need to open issue. Just send us a pull request!\
\
Please be aware of [Standart.py](https://github.com/furkansimsekli/hu-announcement-bot/blob/master/src/scraper/Standart.py). You can scrape some websites of Hacettepe University with the same scraper. So, if standart scraper fits the department you are contrubiting, please use it.\
