# Parsing Methods:

We generally used requests and beautifulsoup4 module for parsing the data from department websites.

# Contribution:

If you are going to add new departments, you don't need to open issue. Just send us a pull request!

Keep in mind, we don't like to use Selenium. If you have another solution beside Selenium, again pull requests are welcome!
