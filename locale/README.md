## How To Add New Language?

1. Create a file named by the standart [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
2. You see.. there are some files named **en.json**, **tr.json**. Copy one of them and paste into your file.
3. Change the texts at the right side with translations. Don't touch key values which are at the left side.

Example:

**en.json**
```json
{
  "greet": "Hello there!",
  "help": "Let me help you!",
  "dnd-btn": "Change DND"
}
```

**tr.json**
```json
{
  "greet": "Merhaba!",
  "help": "Sana yardım edeyim!",
  "dnd-btn": "DND'yi Aç/Kapat"
}
```

## Important Note

Please remember, you don't need to translate them literally. Make them sound natural and right to the context.

After finishing, you can also add yourself down below!
